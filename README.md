# Super-TicTacToe
TicTacToe game but there's a TicTacToe game inside each of the cells.

### How to play
Players have to win TicTacToe games in the cells so that they have won 3 games in a line - just like normal TicTacToe.
The games and cells are indexed with numbers ranging from 1 to 9 in a row-major order.
When a player chooses to fill in a cell in any of the games, the next turn is played in a corresponding location on the SuperTicTacToe board.
If the location of the filled in cell points to an already finished game, the next player can choose any of the remaining ongoing games to play at next.
Won games on the board are marked as cross or circle shapes like in the example picture below.

Have fun!
